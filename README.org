#+TITLE: Emacs Tyrant
#+DESCRIPTION: The Tyranny of the default configuration
#+STARTUP: nohideblocks
#+CATEGORY: EmacsRC
#+KEYWORDS: Emacs config git

- *Bare Introduction*

  This README, the rant below, and the lisp boilerplate about
  sophistication is pretty much as a created it when first making the
  tyrant. I've updated it for this github release, but left the rant
  etc. It is me telling myself why i went down this path and what i
  love and hate about Emacs. You should try it out yourself, its very
  cathartic.

  *Tyrant Test:*

  To test out the tyrant for yourself without crapping over your current
  Emacs config method, simply use these shell commands, or similar:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
mkdir -p testtyrant/tmp; cd testtyrant; git clone https://github.com/timoc/emacs-tyrant .emacs.d ; HOME=$(pwd) emacs
#+END_SRC

or if you prefer:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
mkdir testtyrant
cd testtyrant
mkdir tmp
git clone https://github.com/timoc/emacs-tyrant .emacs.d
HOME=$(pwd) emacs
#+END_SRC

  *Tyrant Quickstart:*

  It's as simple as
  - replacing my Stockholm syndrome rant with your own rant (advised but
    not required) 
  - paste your own elisp init.el between the #+BEGIN & #+END SRC tags. 
  - replace these instructions with the notes, keys etc you want to see
    every time you edit this file 

  Then you're done. 

  Its best to make notes around your code blocks, see examples
  below. Re-factor into smaller source code blocks as appropriate to
  your [[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving][yak shaving]] process.

  *Tyrant Advanced:*

  If you don't follow the Big Fscking Org File approach, then you can
  still use the Tyrant, but you need to put your external modules under
  the Tyrant's boot-heel. 

  To do this the ze@load-tangled-config function, e.g. i want to load
  lame-mode-config.org i could use:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; load lame-mode from lame source somewhere
(ze@load-tangled-config "load lame mode config from somewhere " 
                        (expand-file-name (concat ze:dot-dir "lame-mode-conf.org"))
                        (expand-file-name (concat ze:untangled-lisp-dir "lame-mode-untangled-config.el")))

#+END_SRC

   Remember to add it to the Tyrant f9 fastkey map. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
; Use me@ function namespace for own functions
(defun me@load-lame-tangled () "" (interactive) 
       (find-file (expand-file-name (concat ze:dot-dir "lame-mode-conf.org"))))
(defun me@load-lame-untangled () "" (interactive) 
       (find-file (expand-file-name (concat ze:untangled-lisp-dir "lame-mode-untangled-config.el"))))
;; machine conf key access
(define-key ze:emacs-tangled-config-map [(?a)] 'me@load-lame-tangled)
(define-key ze:emacs-tangled-config-map [(?A)] 'me@load-lame-untangled)
#+END_SRC
  
   *Tyrant Config Default Fastkeys*

   Here are some keys to be getting on with, See help (?) for current
   keymap list. Here are the important ones to get you off the ground
   when debugging your Tyrant installation.

   | Keymap | Key | File              |
   |--------+-----+-------------------|
   | f9     | ?   | Show Tyrantkeymap |
   | f9     | f9  | This file         |
   | f9     | b   | Tyrant init.el    |
   | f9     | B   | local .bashrc     |

* Rant about Emacs and why i became a config-tyrant

  Some people reading this will be like WTF!, why are you still using
  Emacs? We're in a new GUI century! Why not <insert other editor here>.
  Its simple. Emacs is not an Editor. Its a kind of meta-workflow-model
  manager, with its own internal scripting language (elisp in this case).

  Emacs lets you synthesize the output of many processes into a single
  text based visualization, and define your own personal workflow, or
  workflows pioneered in the Emacs community. It allows you to work
  without the need of reaching for a mouse. It allows you to quickly
  remove slack/bumps from your workflow using macros or functions. This
  is why most Emacsers first question about a new tool etc, is 'can i
  use it in Emacs?'.

  Its kind of a Stockholm syndrome, or example of sunk costs fallacy.
  You invest so much time in Emacs you need to have it Emacsable or it
  causes cognitive dissonance. If it does not work in Emacs, you want it
  to have Emacs key-bindings to keep the dissonance to a reasonable
  level.

  *Regardless! I know this but I'm still working with Emacs! :)*

  Why the tyrant? I've been using Emacs for many many years, my hands
  speak its language. I started with Emacs, but then for a long time i
  preferred XEmacs because of the easier package managment, and some
  other subtleties, but i still used Emacs on other systems. In general
  i had an Emacs config that worked for XEmacs and Emacs on Windows,
  Linux, *nix and VMS (yes, VMS!).

  Suffice it to say I've gone through Emacs config bankruptcy more than
  once. I've not kept count, but this is probably the 6Th re-build from
  the shattered ruins of previous configurations.

  The problem is that (x)Emacs is too big and too complex, like some
  kind of spherical Swiss army knife with all the blades extended.

  That is the sweet spot and the fatal flaw. The configuration files are
  like duct-tape on top of it to make it easier to get a handle on, use
  and understand.

  You can duct-tape Emacs to work intuitively with your thought
  processes, but it takes constant vigilance! You need to maintain the
  duct tape or package changes, and differences between Emacs versions
  poke through and sting or cut you during every day use... and out
  comes the duct tape to fix it up again.

  Actually it is worse than that. It is more like the knife is one that
  someone has already used and put down for you to pick up and use. That
  is why its my common practice to try and *set everything* when i
  install a package. Bitter experience has shown that if i do not, then
  someone else will, and things change without notice. My Emacs-foo is
  not up to watching this (advice on defcustom?) but it will.....

  I've looked at my current Emacs config too many times and gone WTF!?
  it has had a good run, must be 3 years? more? So why now? Why a total
  re-build?

  Well I've discovered that org-mode is in Emacs 24, and org-babel, the
  tool that lets you "tangle" source code like elisp into an org-mode
  document is also part of it. I've done some experimental configuration
  with using it for my org-mode configuration, and it looks good. I
  think i can get something maintainable using it in conjunction with
  el-get, that will lower my general WTF, and give my duct-tape usage
  labels, warnings and longevity.

  I've also realized that this Emacs is not an editor, as much as a lisp
  IDE that can be used to run lisp programs to help me edit anything. My
  configuration is in fact a lisp program running inside a relatively
  unknown lisp environment.

  So I have made a decision to run only Emacs 24+, on Linux and
  Windows. If need VMS, or other *nixes, i can use remote editing.
  There were issues for remote file editing on VMS, which i can fix,
  if i need to work on VMS again. I no longer try and keep it XEmacs
  compatible, now that Emacs has native package management and decent
  tramp/VMS ftp support.

  I have also decided to put almost-everything into one or two big
  org-mode files.

  The reasoning for moving all of this into two big files + machine
  includes is simple. After using the split up method for some time
  I've come to the conclusion it is actually harder to maintain. This
  may seem counter-intuitive, but it seems to be true. Bonus feature:
  easier to replicate across machines.

  The biggest problem with the longevity of any of my zemacsian
  configuration has been adaptability. Decisions made to patch up a
  feature or to make life a bit easier don't lend themselves to lengthy
  explanation in elisp commentary. Also i find myself commenting out
  stuff, and crufting links into the file for want of somewhere else to
  keep them.

  The last piece of the puzzle that is tangling with org-mode, now that
  it seems to be working. Using org-mode, and tangling gives me two
  advantages. Firstly, a clean separation between rant like
  documentation, links etc. and code. Secondly, the ability to throw
  "TASK" into the config code and have my task managment tool (org agenda
  in this case!) pick up the note to self, so when i next am in the mood
  for [[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving][yak shaving]] i can do it with more efficiency :)

  - Update:

  After listening to an Emacs chat episode, i have decided to adjust
  the plan for tyranny a bit. That is, to focus on developing
  workflows. That seems to be the natural way for Emacs configuration
  files to evolve. This makes sense, as you apply Emacs to a new
  situation, you tend to want to configure it to make your life
  easier.

  The workflow therefore is something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  10 You work on a project, and develop a workflow/process as you work.
  20 You pause your project work to tweak your Emacs config to improve your workflow/process for the project.
  30 IF *yak shaving* THEN
         GOTO 20
      ELSE
         GOTO 10
#+END_SRC
  - Update 2:
  After blithely promising a release of the full bash+emacs tyrant on
  reddit, i realize it is all not release quality. Also that I'm better
  off trying to split out the Emacs tyrant approach and move it to
  spacemacs, which has the bonus of a community behind it. So I'm now
  working on the 7th re-build of my Emacs configuration from the less
  than shattered remains of my tyrant config. Tyrannical mission
  accomplished!

  org-mode and tangling is the only sophisticated way forward. as you
  can see from my examples below,

  - it helps me maintain my work in progress yak shavings alongside my
    working configurations.

  - I can embed the notes for the 'inspirational' source material i used
    to create a given personal helper

  - I can filter at the babel-src level and at the document level

  - I can publish my Emacs config to github and make it readable.

  My tyrant has been working so well and serving me goodness for over 2
  years, so i think, publish and be damned!

  Hopefully this will benefit those who want a sophisticated way to
  maintain their own .init files.

*** Tyrant Framework Creation [f9] key
    A core part of the tyrant approach is to minimize yak shaving
    when dealing with process changes. That is to define fast keys to
    access all of the process/workflow configuration files, so that if
    a process optimization idea comes up i can sketch it in, or at
    least mind dump the information into the workflow notes.

*** notes on org-mode tangle/untangle usage
    org babel has some explicit rules for managing untangling.
    - :tangle no - to turn off untangling
    - :tangle filename to export support code/shell scripts etc.

    org-mode export can also filter on tags such as :noexport: if
    configured to do so.

    - Bootstrap init.el to setup org-mode and other paths
    - use el-get bundle to initialize

    - using toc: and toc@ to prefix my personal fns and variables
      | Symbol Prefix | Symbol type |
      |---------------+-------------|
      | toc:          | variable    |
      | toc@          | function    |
    - using tyrant: and tyrant@ to prefix tyrant fns and variables

    - As it recreates the emacs init.el based on a literate source, it
      separates the configuration from the local packages, to allow
      you to store your dotfiles in a dropbox folder, so painless
      update of configs between machines. Works out of the box, but is
      as yet not well documented.

**** DONE Create initial bootstrap and tyrant checker
     [X] Create function to speed parse org-tangled config files
     include files with site tweaks

This is the notes/blurb that started the whole thing, before i created
the rant, this was my thinking. Sophistication.

;; - Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe

;;
;; The Tyrant is here to pull your Emacs configuration kicking and
;; screaming to the sophistication stage. Rather than try to figure
;; out how to do something, the tyrant will give you the workflows to
;; start getting things done.
;;
;; The whole concept is based on a single shared Emacs config that can work on
;; multiple hosts and have local and shared configs using cloud storage. Using
;; its bootstrapping it will sync your configuration across devices.
;; NOTE: must have -*- mode:auto-revert -*- for bootstrapping to work properly

;; This is built upon:

;; this init file - which will bootstrap your whole local installation
;; org-mode + org babel - to document the workflow
;; el-get + git - to manage the packages

;;
;; other tools:
;; dropbox - used to synchronize changes across installations

;; use:
;; save this file as your init.el, create a README.org literate init.el
;; update the ze variable to point to the appropriate place.
;; start emacs

;; to make maintenance easier, this sets up f9 as the fast-key-key prefix for aching
;; this file, your org file, and the untangled org files.
